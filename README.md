Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list.

* **Branch**:A branch is a parallel version of a repository (ie; it literally branches out or away from the main repository, kind of like a temporary sub-folder). 
* **Clone**:Clones are literally clones (copies) of a repository that sit on the developer’s computer instead of a server elsewhere.  
* **Commit**:An individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, every time you save it creates a unique ID that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who. 
* **Fetch**:Fetching refers to getting the latest changes from an online repository (like GitHub.com) without merging them in. Once these changes are fetched you can compare them to your local branches (the code residing on your local machine).  
* **GIT**:An open source cod management system. The basic idea of git is to keep track of different versions of code or text, so you easily can compare what has changed. 
* **Github**:Github is like wikipedia for programmers. you can edit files, see who changed what, view old versions of files and access it from anywhere in the world. 
* **Merge**:Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.  
* **Merge Conflict**:Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.  
* **Push**:Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository such as GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you'd want to then push those changes so that others may access them.  
* **Pull**:Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.  
* **Remote**:A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes and it only consists of the .git versioning data.  
* **Repository**:A repository is essentially a project’s folder, repositories store every single project file, its documentation and its revision history of every document. Repositories can also accept multiple private or public collaborators.
